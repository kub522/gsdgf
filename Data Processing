# Genome Data Processing
	This is a full genetic sequence sourced from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, available in FASTA format here. This sequence is short enough to let us experiment with FM-index construction and compression without excessive runtime.
We used Google Colab as our coding environment and Biopython to handle the FASTA file. After loading, we printed the sequence in 50-character chunks to verify that the file was read correctly. Once the raw sequence was extracted, we encoded each nucleotide as an integer using the dictionary A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3, and appended a sentinel value −1 to mark the end of the sequence.
To construct the Burrows–Wheeler Transform (BWT), we generated every suffix of this integer-encoded array and sorted them using the ordering −1 < 0 < 1 < 2 < 3. For each suffix, we recorded the integer appearing immediately before it in the original array. These collected integers form the BWT, which rearranges the sequence to group similar values together. 
Producing the BWT in this integer-based format gives us a representation that is much easier to compress and directly compatible with the FM-index data structures we will build next. Since FM-indexings allows extremely fast pattern searches, this preprocessing step is directly connected to our main objective, efficiently locating trait-associated genetic markers within a genome.
