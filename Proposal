# Final Project Proposal
Our proposed model will utilize known genomic sequences from the NCBI gene and genome databases (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/gene/ and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_000002.12?report=fasta). DNA is composed of nucleotide bases represented by A (adenine), T (thymine), C (cytosine), and G (guanine), which pair A-T and C-G. By recognizing recurring DNA patterns associated with specific traits, our model aims to identify genetic markers linked to phenotypic characteristics such as eye color, hair color, and skin color. There are fully mapped chromosomes of humans that we can utilize to train our model on with known specific genetic conditions. In addition, training a model on data such as this can be a useful diagnostic tool, which could determine if a person is genetically predisposed to certain conditions (i.e., Essential tremor from a specific sequence in Chromosome 2).
Because genomic data functions like a large text sequence, we will use a string-matching and indexing-based search approach rather than graph-based algorithms. We will index the reference genome using an FM index (data structure used for efficient full text searching) and use a seed and extend strategy (heuristic method used for sequence alignment), first locating short exact match “seed” sequences and then extending them to confirm longer alignments. This provides fast and efficient matching across billions of base pairs.
To detect many trait-related sequences simultaneously, we will also use a multi-pattern search algorithm. This method organizes the known marker patterns into a searchable structure and scans the genome in a single pass, efficiently flagging all occurrences of these markers. Together, these techniques allow us to rapidly locate and verify genetic markers across a large dataset.
The system will output a list of detected genetic markers and the traits they are associated with. To evaluate performance, we will compare our detected markers against annotated regions in the reference genome. Success will be based on matching accuracy and correct trait association, as our focus is on computational pattern recognition rather than biological interpretation.
To sum up, this project will analyze publicly available reference data by using FM index with a “seed and extend” strategy and known genetic markers by multi-pattern search to demonstrate the effectiveness of efficient search algorithms for biological sequence analysis. The final project’s success will be evaluated by the accuracy in matching detected markers against known.
